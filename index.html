		<h2>I/O Modules</h2>
	<p>Our design modules for I/O devices means that we can control these things using our product design. These are only some indications. We have used all these I/O (Input and Output) devices in our products like Elevator Controllers, Traffic Lights, Water Filters, Home Light Automation and so on â€¦.<br>

	<h2>Sensor Modules</h2>
	<p>Most of the electronic products need some sensors to monitor some parameters before an action is taken. Simple examples are temperature sensors to switch on/off the air conditioners or speed sensors in vehicles to alert when it over speeds. Here are few sensors that we have expertise in.<br>

	Interested to see them in action? Call us at 9811074026 or send an email to vinay@gvc.in. We will get back to you within 15 minutes.</p>

	<h2>Interface Modules</h2>
	<p>Most of the electronics product need to interface with other electronic products and communicate some thing. A simple example if a remote controls TV Channel. Both are different electronic items and communicate with each other via Infra Red rays. Similarly two different mobiles interface with each other via GSM Network. We have wide range of interface modules.<br>
